## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a detailed simulation of interfacing the [translate:Intel 8086 microprocessor] with a **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** using [translate:Proteus] design software. The main goal is to provide a hands-on practical example of generating analog signals from digital outputs through a DAC controlled by Assembly code on the 8086 microprocessor.

The project integrates:

- **Hardware schematic design** including the DAC0808 and operational amplifier circuits.
- **Assembly language programming** to control microprocessor ports and output data.
- **Visualization of output waveforms** using a virtual oscilloscope to study signal behavior.

## **Files Included**

- **Proteus Circuit Design (.dsn):** Complete schematic to simulate the DAC interface circuit.
- **Assembly Source Code (.asm):** Code written in Assembly language to drive the 8086 microprocessor ports.
- **Supporting Files:** Symbol libraries, list files, and project screenshots showing the simulation output.
- **Screenshots:** Provide references for input-output waveforms observed on the oscilloscope during simulation.

## **How to Run & Test**

1. Open the provided Proteus design file in Proteus software (version 8 or later preferred).
2. Run the simulation to observe the DAC output signals on the digital oscilloscope embedded in the schematic.
3. Use the `.asm` source code with the Emu8086 emulator to simulate code execution, allowing control over DAC input values.
4. Adjust the Assembly code or circuit design to experiment with different signal outputs or behaviors
